      "written" : "There are quite a few vehicles in Ranch Simulator. But there are only a few useful ones. These are the $1250 pickup truck, the $1400 pickup truck, the animal truck and the gator thing. The best vehicle to purchase is the $1400 pickup truck fully upgraded in my opinion. It handles really well in the bush, it can store a ton of items such as meat, wheat bags etc. And it can hold either 2 pigs or 1 cow. It also has one of the best top speeds in the game. What about the $1250 pickup, It can carry the same amount of animals as the $1400 I here you ask. Well let me explain, the $1250 can in fact hold the same exact amount of animals, it also has the fastest acceleration. But the biggest problem is the handling. You will be skidding out, flipping the thing left right and centre. And for $150 more, the $1400 is definitely better.\n",

Roosters allow for fertilised eggs, which can be placed in your medium chicken coop to hatch. How do you know their fertilised? Well the over scope checks for you but chickens do not lay fertilised eggs in the hay area. They lay them anywhere else apart from the hay. So fertilised eggs go into you medium coop to hatch and grow up, and the eggs in the hay go into the basket. Chicks do eventually hatch and they also grow into chickens. But they can rarely grow into a rooster.\r\n\r\nAlways build the feeding trough, to save the hassle of placing grain on the ground. Every day resupply the trough with food and water to ensure they never die.",
