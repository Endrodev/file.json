Many jumps will require a perfect double jump like this so it's important to get the rhythm of this move down.<\/li><li> <b>Ground Pound<\/b>: Jump up and press B\/Circle while in the air to perform a ground pound. This is useful for breaking objects like glass and giving your partner a trampoline-like boost (when possible).<\/li><li> May and Cody can stick to basically any wall in the game. Jump at the wall and keep holding that jump button after hitting the wall. This causes them to stick \u2014 they'll slowly slide down however so do what you need to do quickly.<\/li><li> If you're at a puzzle, assuming that it will have Cody and May doing different things so both players should look around for two things that can be interacted with.<\/li><li> If it looks like you need to crouch, you probably do. You can <b>crouch by pressing B\/Circle.<\/b><\/li><li> If you're struggling to figure out where to go, look for <b>yellow<\/b>. This game uses yellow to signpost to the player what needs to be done \u2014 yellow levers, yellow levers, yellow buttons, and more.<\/li><li> Many of the boss fights in the game will have you using the boss' own weapons against them. If you're stuck trying to figure out how to damage a boss, try and find a way to throw their projectiles or deflect their attacks back to them.<\/li><li> Listen for the taps of a tambourine \u2014 it means a minigame is nearby.<\/li><li> There are 25 minigames in It Takes Two \u2014 they're fun, quick, and easy so keep an eye out for them.<\/li><li> For the most part, <b>Green = Good and Red = Bad<\/b>.<\/li><\/ul>",

Give it a go and see!<\/li><li> Many things like doors can't be opened unless both May and Cody interact with the door (or whatever it is blocking your way forward) at the same time, often by pressing Y\/Triangle.<\/li><li> If you see something like an empty can, there's a good chance you'll need to roll it to a specific area to continue forward. One player should get inside and roll it so that the other player can jump on top of it to advance forward.<\/li><li> Treat this level like an actual shed: If you need to power on a saw, look for an electrical plug near an outlet. You might need to plug that plug into the outlet to power on the saw and proceed forward.<\/li><li> If you see a vacuum hose, don't be alarmed \u2014 either Cody or May will likely need to go into it.<\/li><li> If you see a two-sided hose, there's a good chance either Cody or May will need to aim one end so that the other player can go through the other end and fly out the end being aimed.<\/li><li> If you see a red button, ground pound it.<\/li><li> Fans are powered by air\/wind, right? If you need to go through a fan, try and find a way to get the air\/wind off the fan so that it stops spinning.<\/li><li> When jumping over fans that blow air up, if the light on it is green, it will blow you up. If the light is red, it will suck you up and kill you. There's often a switch nearby to change the air flow.<\/li><li> When you jump into a funnel, be prepared for it to shoot you high into the air. So high, in fact, that you'll be able to control where May or Cody float down too. Make sure to aim for the ground or the next funnel.<\/li><li> Some puzzle will require you to suck things up \u2014 look around for (usually red) things to suck up.<\/li><li> Water is bad \u2014 if you see water, you'll die if you fall into it.<\/li><li> Cody will eventually get a nail that he can shoot (well, even further along he'll have three nails) and May will get a hammer. May can use the hammer to connect to nails that Cody has shot.<\/li><li> Cody will need to shoot nails into things to make them stick \u2014 look for a circle to shoot a nail into in order to hold something in place.<\/li><li> If there's a glass bottle, May can break it with her hammer.<\/li><li> If you see a yellow piece of wood, Cody will likely need to shoot a nail into it.<\/li><li> If something is falling from the sky, keep an eye out for the shape of its shadow on the ground. Make sure you're not standing on the shadow if you want to avoid damage.<\/li><li> When riding the rails, you can dash forward by pressing X\/Square and you can jump by pressing A\/X. Make sure to either jump over blueish-white sparks coming down the rail or jump to a nearby rail by pressing RB\/R1.<\/li><\/ul>",

The player will need two burning miners to start the coal mining process. Begin by placing the miners next to each other and then rotating the miners until the miners' outputs are going into one another. Fuel one of the miners, and it will place coal into the adjacent burning miner, creating a perpetual coal mining machine! The player should now view their map and turn on the pollution filter. The red covering the map represents the distance your pollution has traveled. If it reaches the locals (the red blips on the map), they will begin to accelerate in spawn rate and become increasingly hostile. Unlike Ark: Survival Evolved, none of these creatures are friendly, and they cannot be tamed.",

While doing so, use the extra coal in your coal miners to keep the factory fueled. Once the player has seven or eight furnaces making copper plates, craft more burning miners and return to the coal plot. Place two miners next to the existing ones, creating a square. Rotate the miners until each miner is providing coal to another miner. Miner A should go into miner B, miner B into C, C to D, then D into A. The player can expand this by either creating a new loop or adding to the current loop. Each miner should only have one miner inputting coal. Collect the coal from all the miners; only one piece of coal is needed to start this mining system. Remember to keep all the miners and furnaces on your resources topped up on coal!",

	  "written4" : "\nDungeon Crawler\n\n<ul><li> This section of the game is very similar to Diablo in that it's a top-down RPG: both players have three standard attacks and one special attack. <\/li><li> To use the special attack, you must use your other three attacks to charge up the bar at the bottom of the left and right corners of the screen \u2014 when it's glowing, press Y\/Triangle to use the attack. <\/li><li> You can basically just spam attacks to take out most enemies. <\/li><li> If an enemy has a shield, you'll need to get behind it to damage it. <\/li><li> When fighting the miniboss knight, pay attention to the three purple lines \u2014 three, damaging magic balls are about to shoot down this lane. <\/li><li> May can traverse across gaps with her fire dash and Cody can teleport through iron gates with his teleportation ability. <\/li><li> When you see fire plumes, Cody can freeze them to turn the fire into a platform that Cody and May can walk across. <\/li><li> To defeat the troll, keep an eye out for chains in the room \u2014 the objective is to destroy the chains. <\/li><li> This section is quite chaotic: if you get lost, Cody has a blue circle around him and May has a green circle around her. <\/li><li> Boss Guide for tips on how to defeat the boss of this section. <\/li><\/ul>\n\nThe Queen\n<ul><li> This section is relatively chill, albeit somewhat emotionally draining in that you're going to be...saying goodbye...to Cutie the Elephant. <\/li><li> When you're in control of May and Cody, go up the stairs to find a cardboard claw machine: use the arrows to move the claw and ground pound the button in the middle of the arrows to drop the claw. You'll know what you're after when you hit this point. <\/li><li> After the claw machine part, the only other thing you'll be doing in this section is repeatedly pressing Y\/Triangle so be ready for that at all times.<\/li><\/ul>"
